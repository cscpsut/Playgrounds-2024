# Description:
In the heart of ancient Egypt, Cleopatra's Treasury is said to hold priceless secrets. Cleopatra, however, is no longer a queen but a web server, guarding precious data behind layers of security. But just like in the ancient days when invaders sought to break into royal vaults, someone has managed to get a foothold on Cleopatra, and the treasury has been breached.

Your task as a digital archaeologist is to investigate the break-in, uncover the attacker's methods, and track down the missing treasures. The attacker has left behind subtle clues. Can you piece together the puzzle and restore Cleopatra's legacy?
