# Chall_name: Eye of Ra's Precision
## Author: janajamal

## Description:
In the land of the Pharaohs, precision was key to keeping things in harmony. The royal scribes have sent you a sacred email, encoded with ancient symbols. To unlock its true meaning, you must extract the exact moment it was **sent** â€”down to the millisecond.

Beware, however, for the scribes were known to test the boundaries of time itself. Can you decode the timestamp and bring balance to Ra's eternal cycle?
