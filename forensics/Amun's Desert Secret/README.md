Description:
Deep within the heart of the desert, an ancient relic known as "Amun's Desert Secret" has been uncovered. You are provided with a memory dump from an archaeological expedition's computer system. The archaeologists believe that a hidden file, associated with the relic, contains critical data. Conventional methods have failed to uncover the hidden information, but you suspect that the answer lies in something almost visible, yet unseen.
