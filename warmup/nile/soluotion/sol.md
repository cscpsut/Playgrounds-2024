Here's the step-by-step process:

Calculate the target value in the context of overflow:

The target value is `-42000000`.
In a 32-bit signed integer, `-42000000` can be represented as `2^32 - 42000000` because of the way negative numbers are stored (two's complement representation).
Calculate the equivalent positive value:

2^32 is 4294967296.
So, `-42000000` is equivalent to `4294967296 - 42000000`.
Perform the calculation: `4294967296 - 42000000 = 4252967296`

Determine the number to add:

We need to find y such that `2144444444 + y` results in `4252967296` (which will overflow to -42000000).
Calculate y:  `y = 4252967296 - 2144444444`  `y = 2108522852`

So, the positive number y that you need to add to 2144444444 to get -42000000 due to overflow is `2108522852`.
