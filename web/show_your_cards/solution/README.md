Basic SQLi, when you try a simple payload like (' or 1=1-- ) it will show you an error message saying becareful you are using more than one card. Meaning that there is a condition that allows only one user to login, so you need to use limit to make your query output only one user so you can pass with one user, the payload will look like this: (' or 1=1 LIMIT 1-- ), this will allow you to bypass and login.
